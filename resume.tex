\section{Professional Summary}
I am a recent graduate who is passionate about the design and analysis of
aviation and space systems, including but not limited to satellites, human
spaceflight, spacecraft and aircraft structures, propulsion, mechanisms,
imaging, and controls. I am relentlessly curious, a strong visionary, and
optomistic about the future of technology and humankind.
